# Spryker Feature: Customer Notes

The Customer Notes feature enables the shop administrators to add internal notes for customers in the dedicated area on View Customer page in the Administrator Interface. The Customer Notes are visible by the shop administrators only and contain actual comment for the customer, name of the user who posted the comment as well as date and time of the comment.
